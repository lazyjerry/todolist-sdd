# Feature Specification: TODO List Backend API

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-list-1`  
**Created**: 2025 年 9 月 9 日  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "實現一個 TODO LIST 的後端工具。請優先實現以下功能：1. 新增任務 POST /todos 2.查看所有任務 GET /todos 3.更新任務狀態 PATCH/PUT /todos/{id} 4.刪除任務 DELETE /todos/{id} 5.任務欄位至少需包含 title, description"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature description provided: TODO list backend with basic CRUD operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: API consumers/clients
   → Actions: create, read, update, delete tasks
   → Data: tasks with title and description
   → Constraints: standard HTTP methods, specific endpoints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Authentication/authorization requirements need clarification
   → Task status/completion field specifications need clarification
   → Data validation rules need clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear CRUD operations flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Basic CRUD operations are testable
   → Some requirements marked for clarification
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Task entity with title and description
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an API consumer, I want to manage a collection of TODO tasks through a backend service so that I can build applications that help users organize their tasks and track completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no existing tasks, **When** I create a new task with title and description, **Then** the task is stored and I receive confirmation with task details
2. **Given** existing tasks in the system, **When** I request all tasks, **Then** I receive a list of all tasks with their current information
3. **Given** an existing task, **When** I update its status or other properties, **Then** the changes are persisted and reflected in subsequent queries
4. **Given** an existing task, **When** I delete it, **Then** the task is removed from the system and no longer appears in task lists

### Edge Cases

- What happens when creating a task with missing required fields (title/description)?
- How does the system handle updates to non-existent tasks?
- What is the behavior when deleting an already deleted task?
- How are empty or overly long titles/descriptions handled?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of new tasks with title and description fields
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide endpoint to retrieve all existing tasks
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow updating of existing tasks by unique identifier
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow deletion of tasks by unique identifier
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all task data between requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate required fields (title, description) on task creation
- **FR-007**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes for different operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle requests for non-existent tasks gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST assign unique identifiers to each task upon creation
- **FR-010**: System MUST support task status updates [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what status values are allowed - completed/pending, or other states?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate/authorize requests [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication mechanism not specified - public API, API keys, user sessions?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate input data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific validation rules for title/description length, format, etc.]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Task**: Represents a TODO item with at minimum a title (brief description) and description (detailed information), unique identifier for referencing, and status tracking capability
